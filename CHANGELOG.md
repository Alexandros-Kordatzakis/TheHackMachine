## ~ Version 1.0.5 - 2020/05/06 ~


* CHANGELOG added!

### C# Version &nbsp; {
* **MAJOR FEATURE:**  .exe Added! Now the C# version of TheHackMachine is a Normal EXE application!
* **FIXED Report.txt Bug**: Now Report.txt can be saved in every PC the program runs at, under *C:/Users/Default/Documents/Report.txt* . 
###### Thanks Discord user @Yasahiro#5084, whoever you are.

* **ADDED app.manifest**: The aforementioned Feauture requires Admin Privileges in order to save the file. Within app.manifest, Security was escalated so the TheHackMachine.exe will always require Admin Rrivileges. 
###### Future suggestion: Ask the user at first if he wants a Report at the end, then decide if Admin Rights are needed...
